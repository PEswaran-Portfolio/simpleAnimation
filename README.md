# CoolAnimationsSpa
Just a simple animation Single Page Application utilizing the power or Angular2

This project was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

The purpose of this project is to present and host code exercises for
demonstrative purposes.
This application uses basic css styling and incoporates the use of keyframes for animations.

1.Exercising the SASS preprocessor to organize and utilize css stylesheets.

    -KeyNotes:
      initialise your project using gitinit
      push your code to master
      you will need to install angular-cli-ghpages to deploy the project with a build from dist folder.

If it's free, why not? Thanks people at GitHub!!
